### Step Two - Create a repository and upload project

Based on github flow, uploading an existing project is as follows: 

> Create -> Clone -> Copy+Paste -> Add -> commit -> Push


#### 1. Create ####

Create a repository named "homework".

#### 2. Clone ####

Select a directory in local computer and clone the newly created repository to that directory.
> git clone https://github.com/ddwwjj/homework.git

#### 3. Copy+Paste ####

Copy the project ready to upload and paste it to the directory 

#### 4. Add ####

Add the project to the staging area so that Git could start tracking changes made to that project
> git add filename (file)

or
> git add projectname (directory)

#### 5. Commit ####

Commit command is for storing staged changes, it is like a snapshot of the repository.
> git commid -m "first change"

#### 6. Push ####

The push command tells Git where to put commits when it's ready. Push the changes to master branch.
> git push origin master
